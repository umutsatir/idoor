# iDoor Website

An Arduino project that allows you to open a door using an RFID card is a great way to add a level of convenience and security to your home or office. The project involves using an Arduino board, an RFID reader, and a servo motor to control the door lock. The Arduino was programmed to listen for a specific RFID card to be scanned. When the correct RFID card is scanned, the servo motor rotates to unlock the door. The website could be accessed from any device connected to the internet, allowing you to check the door. Additionally, it has a log system to keep track of the time and date of when the door was opened, who opened it and when it was opened. This project is a perfect example of how Arduino can be used to create smart and secure systems that improve daily life.
